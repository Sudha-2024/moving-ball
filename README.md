# moving-ball

- This HTML document creates a simple animation of a ball moving diagonally across the screen.

- The ball is styled as a green circle using inline CSS.

- JavaScript controls the animation, with a variable for velocity and position.

- The ball moves in both horizontal and vertical directions.

- When it reaches the edges of the viewport, it reverses direction.

- The movement is updated every 100 milliseconds, creating a smooth visual effect.
